# Android_CriminalIntent
CriminalIntent records the details of “office crimes” – things like leaving dirty dishes in the breakroom sink 
or walking away from an empty shared printer after documents have printed.

The app can take evidence pics, store data in the database, send crime reports with other apps, gets suspect's name from the phone contacts. The app is accessible for users with a visual impairment & is localized in Spanish.
